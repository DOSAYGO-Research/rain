## 1. Standard Constructions: Block Cipher to Cryptographic Hash

### 1.1 Davies-Meyer Construction

The Davies-Meyer (DM) construction is a well-known method to build a cryptographic hash function from a block cipher. Given a block cipher $` E_k `$ that maps a key $` k `$ and a block $` M `$ to a ciphertext $` C `$, the DM construction defines the compression function $` h `$ as follows:

```math
h(H_{i-1}, M_i) = E_{M_i}(H_{i-1}) \oplus H_{i-1}
```

- **Parameters**:
  - $` H_{i-1} `$: The previous hash state (output of the previous compression).
  - $` M_i `$: The current message block.
  - $` E_{M_i} `$: The block cipher encryption function with key $` M_i `$.
  - $` \oplus `$: Bitwise XOR operation.

- **Initialization**:
  - $` H_0 `$: An initial vector (IV) of appropriate size.

- **Hash Computation**:
  - For each message block $` M_i `$, compute $` H_i = h(H_{i-1}, M_i) `$.
  - The final hash is $` H_n `$, where $` n `$ is the number of blocks.

### 1.2 Merkle-Damgård Construction

Another standard method is the Merkle-Damgård (MD) construction, which can use various compression functions, including those derived from block ciphers. The general form is:

```math
H_i = f(H_{i-1}, M_i)
```

Where $` f `$ is a compression function that combines the previous hash state with the current message block. While DM is a specific instance of MD using block ciphers, MD can also employ other primitives.

## 2. Custom Block Cipher Construction from a Non-Cryptographic Hash Function

Your proposal involves constructing a block cipher from a non-cryptographic (good mixing) hash function $` H `$. Let's formalize this construction mathematically and provide pseudocode.

### 2.1 Block Cipher Construction

#### **Encryption Process**

Given:
- **Key**: $` K `$ (fixed-length bitstring)
- **Plaintext Block**: $` P `$ (fixed-length bitstring)
- **Nonce**: $` N `$ (variable-length bitstring, typically random or sequential)

**Steps**:
1. **Concatenation**: $` K \| N `$
2. **Hashing**: Compute $` D = H(K \| N) `$
3. **Check for Inclusion**: Verify if all bytes of $` P `$ are present in $` D `$
4. **Index Extraction**: If present, record the indices $` \{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_m\} `$ where each byte of $` P `$ appears in $` D `$
5. **Output**: $` C = (N, \{i_j\}) `$

If not all bytes are present, iterate with a new nonce $` N' `$.

#### **Decryption Process**

Given:
- **Key**: $` K `$
- **Ciphertext**: $` C = (N, \{i_j\}) `$

**Steps**:
1. **Concatenation**: $` K \| N `$
2. **Hashing**: Compute $` D = H(K \| N) `$
3. **Byte Extraction**: Extract bytes at indices $` \{i_j\} `$ from $` D `$
4. **Reconstruct Plaintext**: $` P = \{D[i_1], D[i_2], \ldots, D[i_m]\} `$

**Pseudocode for Encryption:**

```python
def encrypt(K, P, H):
    while True:
        N = generate_nonce()
        D = H(K + N)
        indices = find_indices(D, P)
        if indices is not None:
            return (N, indices)
```

**Pseudocode for Decryption:**

```python
def decrypt(K, C, H):
    N, indices = C
    D = H(K + N)
    P = extract_bytes(D, indices)
    return P
```

### 2.2 Mathematical Representation

Let:
- $` H: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n `$ be the hash function.
- $` P = p_1 p_2 \ldots p_m `$, where $` p_j \in \{0,1\}^b `$ (byte length $` b `$).

**Encryption Equation:**

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Find } N \in \{0,1\}^* \text{ such that } \forall p_j \in P, \exists i_j \text{ with } D[i_j] = p_j \\
& D = H(K \| N) \\
& C = (N, \{i_j\})
\end{aligned}
```

**Decryption Equation:**

```math
P = \{ D[i_j] \mid j = 1, 2, \ldots, m \}
```

## 3. Combining the Constructions: Enhancing Security

Once we have a block cipher $` E `$ constructed from the non-cryptographic hash $` H `$, we can employ the Davies-Meyer (or another) construction to build a cryptographic hash function $` G `$.

### 3.1 Combined Construction

```math
G(H_{i-1}, M_i) = E_{M_i}(H_{i-1}) \oplus H_{i-1}
```

Where:
- $` E_{M_i} `$ is the block cipher constructed from $` H `$ as described above.
- $` H_{i-1} `$ is the previous hash state.
- $` M_i `$ is the current message block.

### 3.2 Mathematical Formulation

Assume:
- $` E_{M_i}(H_{i-1}) = (N_i, \{j_k\}) `$, where $` N_i `$ is the nonce found during encryption, and $` \{j_k\} `$ are the indices corresponding to the plaintext block.

The hash state update becomes:

```math
H_i = E_{M_i}(H_{i-1}) \oplus H_{i-1}
```

Given the construction of $` E `$, this can be expanded as:

```math
H_i = (N_i, \{j_k\}) \oplus H_{i-1}
```

*Note*: The XOR operation here is conceptual; in practice, the combination of nonce and indices would need to be encoded into a fixed-size block compatible with $` H_{i-1} `$.

---

## 4. Cryptographic Analysis with Mathematical Rigor

### 4.1 Security Goals

For the resulting hash function $` G `$ to be cryptographically secure, it must satisfy:

1. **Preimage Resistance**: Given $` h `$, finding $` (H_{i-1}, M_i) `$ such that $` G(H_{i-1}, M_i) = h `$ should be computationally infeasible.

2. **Second Preimage Resistance**: Given $` (H_{i-1}, M_i) `$, finding $` M_i' \neq M_i `$ such that $` G(H_{i-1}, M_i) = G(H_{i-1}, M_i') `$ should be hard.

3. **Collision Resistance**: Finding any two distinct inputs $` (H_{i-1}, M_i) `$ and $` (H_{j-1}, M_j) `$ such that $` G(H_{i-1}, M_i) = G(H_{j-1}, M_j) `$ should be difficult.

### 4.2 Analyzing the Block Cipher $` E `$

#### **Invertibility and Attack Surface**

The block cipher $` E `$ constructed from $` H `$ is invertible by design, as per your construction. However, the security of $` E `$ depends on:

1. **Difficulty of Finding $` N `$ Given $` P `$ and $` K `$**: The encryption step involves finding a nonce $` N `$ such that $` H(K \| N) `$ contains $` P `$. If $` H `$ is non-cryptographic, this process might be susceptible to preimage or structure-based attacks.

2. **Uniqueness and Randomness of $` N `$**: If the selection of $` N `$ can be predicted or if $` H `$ introduces biases, the block cipher $` E `$ may leak information about $` K `$ or $` P `$.

3. **Resistance to Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis**: The non-cryptographic nature of $` H `$ may introduce patterns or linear relations that can be exploited.

#### **Mathematical Vulnerabilities**

Let’s consider the following potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Linearity**:

   If $` H `$ exhibits linear properties, such as:

   ```math
   H(a \| N_1) \oplus H(b \| N_2) = H(a \oplus b \| N_1 \oplus N_2)
   ```

   Then, attackers can exploit this linearity to find relationships between different ciphertexts.

2. **Differential Behavior**:

   If small changes in $` K `$ or $` N `$ lead to predictable changes in $` D = H(K \| N) `$, then differential attacks can be mounted.

### 4.3 Impact on the Hash Function $` G `$

Even if $` E `$ has certain vulnerabilities, the hash function $` G `$ might inherit or amplify these issues. For example:

1. **Collision Propagation**:

   If $` E `$ is prone to collisions, then $` G `$ will also be susceptible since $` G `$ relies on $` E `$ to process each message block.

2. **Preimage and Second Preimage**:

   Weaknesses in $` E `$ directly translate to weaknesses in finding preimages for $` G `$.

---

## 5. Potential Attacks and Vulnerabilities

Let's explore specific attack vectors that could compromise the security of the proposed hash function $` G `$.

### 5.1 Preimage Attack

**Goal**: Given a hash output $` h `$, find a message $` M `$ such that $` G(\text{IV}, M) = h `$.

**Attack Steps**:

1. **Target**: Identify a specific $` H_i = h `$ by reversing the hash function.
2. **Exploitation**: Use the invertibility of $` E `$ to reverse-engineer $` N `$ and $` \{j_k\} `$ from $` h `$.
3. **Reconstruction**: Once $` N `$ is found, reconstruct $` K `$ or $` P `$ by exploiting structural weaknesses in $` H `$.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

Given $` H_i = (N_i, \{j_k\}) \oplus H_{i-1} = h `$, solve for $` N_i `$ and $` \{j_k\} `$:

```math
(N_i, \{j_k\}) = h \oplus H_{i-1}
```

Since $` H `$ is non-cryptographic and invertible, if $` H `$ is weak, this equation might be solvable without exhaustive search.

### 5.2 Collision Attack

**Goal**: Find two distinct messages $` M `$ and $` M' `$ such that $` G(\text{IV}, M) = G(\text{IV}, M') `$.

**Attack Steps**:

1. **Collision in $` E `$**: Find two different message blocks $` M `$ and $` M' `$ that produce the same $` E_{M}(H_{i-1}) `$.

2. **Hash Collision**: Since $` G `$ relies on $` E `$, a collision in $` E `$ leads directly to a collision in $` G `$.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

Find $` M \neq M' `$ such that:

```math
E_{M}(H_{i-1}) \oplus H_{i-1} = E_{M'}(H_{i-1}) \oplus H_{i-1}
```

Which simplifies to:

```math
E_{M}(H_{i-1}) = E_{M'}(H_{i-1})
```

If $` E `$ is weak, finding such $` M `$ and $` M' `$ becomes feasible.

### 5.3 Linear Cryptanalysis

**Goal**: Exploit linear approximations between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key.

**Attack Steps**:

1. **Identify Linear Relations**: Discover equations where certain linear combinations of plaintext bits, ciphertext bits, and key bits hold with higher probability.

2. **Statistics Gathering**: Collect a large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs to find biases in these linear relations.

3. **Solve for Key Bits**: Use the biases to derive information about the key $` K `$.

**Mathematical Example**:

Suppose $` H `$ satisfies:

```math
H(K \| N) = a(K) \cdot N + b(K)
```

for some linear functions $` a `$ and $` b `$. Then,

```math
E_M(H_{i-1}) = (N, \{j_k\}) = H(K \| N) \implies (N, \{j_k\}) = a(K) \cdot N + b(K)
```

This linear relationship can be exploited to solve for $` K `$.

### 5.4 Differential Cryptanalysis

**Goal**: Analyze how differences in input pairs affect the resultant difference at the output.

**Attack Steps**:

1. **Choose Differing Inputs**: Select two nonces $` N `$ and $` N' = N \oplus \Delta N `$.

2. **Analyze Output Differences**: Compute $` D = H(K \| N) `$ and $` D' = H(K \| N') `$ and analyze $` \Delta D = D \oplus D' `$.

3. **Propagate Differences**: Observe how differences in $` D `$ affect the indices $` \{j_k\} `$ and consequently the hash state $` H_i `$.

**Mathematical Formulation**:

Given $` \Delta N = N \oplus N' `$:

```math
\Delta D = H(K \| N) \oplus H(K \| N') = H(K \| N) \oplus H(K \| N \oplus \Delta N)
```

If $` H `$ is linear or has predictable differential patterns, $` \Delta D `$ can reveal information about $` K `$ or $` N `$.

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

### 6.1 Summary of Findings

- **Invertibility vs. Security**: While invertibility in the state transformation avoids entropy loss and ensures long cycles, it inherently introduces vulnerabilities that are exploitable, especially if the underlying hash function $` H `$ lacks cryptographic robustness.

- **Dependence on $` H `$**: The security of both the custom block cipher $` E `$ and the resulting hash function $` G `$ heavily depends on the cryptographic strength of $` H `$. Non-cryptographic hashes typically fail to provide properties like preimage resistance, collision resistance, and diffusion, making them unsuitable as foundations for cryptographic constructions.

- **Potential for Enhanced Security**: Standard constructions like Davies-Meyer rely on the assumption that the underlying block cipher is secure. Introducing a weak block cipher undermines this assumption, and standard transformations do not inherently compensate for the block cipher's deficiencies.

### 6.2 Recommendations

1. **Use Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Instead of starting with a non-cryptographic hash $` H `$, employ a cryptographic hash function that satisfies necessary security properties. This foundation is crucial for building secure cryptographic primitives.

2. **Enhance Block Cipher Security**: If you wish to proceed with constructing a block cipher from a hash function, incorporate additional cryptographic mechanisms to mitigate weaknesses. For example:
   - **Nonlinearity**: Introduce nonlinear transformations to disrupt linear patterns.
   - **S-boxes**: Utilize substitution boxes to obscure input-output relations.
   - **Multiple Rounds**: Apply multiple hashing iterations with varying nonces and transformations to increase complexity.

3. **Formal Security Proofs**: Develop rigorous mathematical proofs or reductions that demonstrate the security properties of the combined construction $` G `$, ensuring that vulnerabilities in $` E `$ do not propagate to $` G `$.

4. **Prototype and Analyze**: Implement the proposed construction and subject it to standard cryptanalytic evaluations. Practical testing can reveal vulnerabilities not apparent in theoretical analysis.

5. **Community Review**: Engage with the cryptographic community for peer review. Independent analysis is vital for identifying and addressing potential security flaws.

6. **Avoid Reinventing Primitives**: Given the maturity of existing cryptographic hash functions and block cipher constructions, carefully evaluate whether a new construction offers significant advantages over established standards.

        H2 = G(H, K, M2)
        if H1 == H2:
            return (M1, M2)
        hash_map[H1] = M1
    return None
```

*Explanation*: Generate hash outputs for different message pairs and check for collisions by comparing hash outputs.
