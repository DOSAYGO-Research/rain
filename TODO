cipher improvement

- ensure we can pass in salt 0x0 or 0x1 or 0 and it is valid in both js and cpp
- use irradix l1 to encode and decode scatter indices
- let key material come from a file not just a password or -P command line arg
- use 'more secure' randomness source in cpp
- write hmac testing tampering tests

Later maybe

- ensure key privacy in memory, by checking raw keys:
  - Are wiped from memory after use (consider std::fill or explicit_bzero for zeroing memory).
  - Avoid storing plaintext keys in memory longer than necessary.
