- solve speed discrepancy between v1.2.2 digest mode and current digest mode in JS/WASM
- use 'more secure' randomness source in cpp
- let key material come from a file not just a password or -P command line arg
- use irradix l1 to encode and decode scatter indices
- write hmac testing tampering tests
- add hmac to js version

Later maybe

- ensure key privacy in memory, by checking raw keys:
  - Are wiped from memory after use (consider std::fill or explicit_bzero for zeroing memory).
  - Avoid storing plaintext keys in memory longer than necessary.
