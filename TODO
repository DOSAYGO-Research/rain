cipher improvement

- implement a js version of enc / dec

Later maybe
- test research construct
    weak hash -- digest mining construction --> block cipher --- davies meyer construction ---> strong hash 

- ensure we print out the inc nonce for mining and rand nonce for mining (right now we just show the iter count, and lose the rand nonce)
