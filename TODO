cipher improvement

- use 'more secure' randomness source
- let key material come from a file not just a password or -P command line arg
- write tests, including hmac testing tampering tests
- use nis1 and rp variants if specified. and always use nis1 as default for any cipher mode
- test research construct
    weak hash -- digest mining construction --> block cipher --- davies meyer construction ---> strong hash 
  by prototyping in js
- implement a js version of enc / dec

Later maybe


- ensure key privacy in memory, by checking raw keys:
  - Are wiped from memory after use (consider std::fill or explicit_bzero for zeroing memory).
  - Avoid storing plaintext keys in memory longer than necessary.

- stream input in for compress / decompress and stream and block ciphers. Don't just read it all in, it's crass

- ensure we print out the inc nonce for mining and rand nonce for mining (right now we just show the iter count, and lose the rand nonce)
