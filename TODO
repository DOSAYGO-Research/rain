cipher improvement

- add true scatter (P can be in any order). 
- schedule K into block keys via XOF
- implement a js version of enc / dec
- test research construct
    weak hash -- digest mining construction --> block cipher --- davies meyer construction ---> strong hash 

Later maybe
- parallelization for cipher mining efficiency
- ensure we output inc nonce for mining and rand nonce for mining (right now we just show the iter count, and lose the rand nonce)
