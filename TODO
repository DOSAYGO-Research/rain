cipher improvement

- let key material come from a file not just a password or -P command line arg
- use 'more secure' randomness source in cpp
- write tests, including hmac testing tampering tests

Later maybe

- ensure key privacy in memory, by checking raw keys:
  - Are wiped from memory after use (consider std::fill or explicit_bzero for zeroing memory).
  - Avoid storing plaintext keys in memory longer than necessary.
