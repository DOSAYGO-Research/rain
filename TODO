cipher improvement

- test research construct
    weak hash -- digest mining construction --> block cipher --- davies meyer construction ---> strong hash 
  by prototyping in js
- let key material come from a file not just a password or -P command line arg
- write tests, including hmac testing tampering tests
- implement a js version of enc / dec

Later maybe
- stream input in for compress / decompress and stream and block ciphers. Don't just read it all in, it's crass

- ensure we print out the inc nonce for mining and rand nonce for mining (right now we just show the iter count, and lose the rand nonce)
