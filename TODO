cipher improvement

- schedule K into block keys via XOF
- extend effective digest size with XOF as this will add speed for larger blocks (more chances to find P in larger D)
- implement a js version of enc / dec
- test research construct
    weak hash -- digest mining construction --> block cipher --- davies meyer construction ---> strong hash 

Later maybe
- ensure we print out the inc nonce for mining and rand nonce for mining (right now we just show the iter count, and lose the rand nonce)
